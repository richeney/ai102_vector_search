# Vector Search Quickstart

The Postman collection, [Vector-Search-Quickstart.postman_collection v1.0 json](https://github.com/Azure/cognitive-search-vector-pr/tree/main/postman-collection), converted for use with REST Client.

This can be used in the exercise in the [Improve search results using vector search in Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/improve-search-results-vector-search/) Azure Learn module.

Requires the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) vscode extension.

Need to move sensitive file variables to a vscode secret.
